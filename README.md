# Hydrogen-Assisted Cracking (HAC) Analysis Framework

## Introduction
This project focuses on the development of a Python framework for analyzing Hydrogen-Assisted Cracking (HAC). The framework aims to provide researchers and engineers with an efficient tool for simulating and studying the effects of hydrogen on material cracking behavior. The analysis focuses on both tensile and shear loading conditions to evaluate reaction forces and displacements under varying hydrogen concentrations.

This work explores the influence of hydrogen embrittlement on material failure mechanisms, contributing valuable insights to improve the durability and reliability of materials in hydrogen-related applications.

## Methodology
The project utilizes Python-based finite element analysis (FEA) tools, incorporating specific algorithms for simulating crack propagation under hydrogen environments. Key features of the methodology include:
- **Finite Element Modeling**: Structural elements are modeled using FEM to understand stress distribution and crack initiation.
- **Hydrogen Concentration Analysis**: A detailed simulation of how different levels of hydrogen affect crack growth.
- **Loading Conditions**: Both tensile and shear stresses are applied to evaluate material performance.
- **Phase Field Method**: This method is used to predict crack initiation and growth under hydrogen influence, using the phi parameter for phase field simulations.

  
Additional tools such as Python-based solvers and post-processing scripts are used to visualize the results and extract useful insights from the simulations.

## Results
The results section includes visual data such as concentration, displacement fields, and phase field (phi) animations under different loading conditions. These results help in understanding the relationship between hydrogen concentration and crack propagation in materials.
